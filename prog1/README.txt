prog1

To compile I used "$ gcc -o linked linkedLists.c"

Running the executable will welcome the user to the interface in terminal and provide
a list of options available to the user. The user can enter the number of the action
they would like to perform and may be prompted for more info based on the selection.
After each action that adds or removes a node, the new list is printed in terminal
before prompting the user for their next action. 

The actions offered by the interface are only those stated on the Prog1 Instructions.

The value of 6 closes the interface.
